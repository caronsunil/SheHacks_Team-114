## Problem- 
People who want to volunteer for a social cause but donâ€™t have the time to commit to an organization full-time are unable to find where and whom to approach. Also, individuals or organizations/NGOs who want volunteers for a specific event but are unable to find them every time.

## Solution

Helping Hands provides a platform where any organization or individual wishing to set up any charity/humanitarian/environmental event that requires volunteers can make a form with the description of the event.
